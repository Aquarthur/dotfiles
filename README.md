# Dotfiles

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, run `./bootstrap.sh`. **Please note**: this will replace existing configuration files in your home directory, so be careful!

Also note that the included `.vimrc` is only there temporarily and is not installed by the `bootstrap.sh` script! I am working on a more complex setup but have a lot of reading + writing to do.

## ZSH

### Performance

On my local machine, zsh is up and ready to use in around 1/20th of a second, as seen below (the `startup_check` function is defined in `.zshrc`):

```shell

```

Note: I used to use [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit), and while the initial start-up was faster, the first interactions
with the terminal lagged - I'd often have to wait a few seconds for it to catch up.
