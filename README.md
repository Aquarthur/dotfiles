# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. I'm not a particularly avid user of tools like vim so for now I only have a `.zshrc` and `.zaliases`.

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, run `./bootstrap.sh`. **Please note**: this will replace existing configuration files in your home directory, so be careful!

Also note that the included `.vimrc` is only there temporarily and is not installed by the `bootstrap.sh` script! I am working on a more complex setup but have a lot of reading + writing to do.

## ZSH

### Performance

On my local machine, zsh is up and ready to use in just under ~0.05s, as seen below (the `startup_check` function is defined in `.zshrc`):

```shell
~/dev/projects/dotfiles master

```

I have a similar setup on my work machine and it's slightly slower (but still very fast) there, at just over ~0.10s.

Either way, everything loads in very quickly thanks to [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit). It's not the easiest plugin manager to learn but I really recommend it if you're looking for a faster shell!
